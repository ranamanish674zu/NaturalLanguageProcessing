# NaturalLanguageProcessing
Natural Language Processing is a form of AI that gives machines the ability to not just read, but to understand and interpret human language. With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.
